# Classes - Template
# Object - Instance Of the Class

# DRY - Do not repeat Yourself

What is Python Class And Object?
A class is a collection of objects, and an object is defined as an instance of class possessing attributes. The object is an entity that has state and behavior. A class has all the similar attributes, like if we have a class students, then it will only consist of students related data, such as subjects, names, attendance ratio, etc.

Along with classes and objects, you will learn many new terminologies related to OOP in further tutorials. Some of these terminologies are:

Instances
Constructor
Methods
Abstraction
Inheritance
By using oop, we can divide our code into many sections known as classes. Each class holds a distinct purpose or usage. For example, if we have created a class named "Books" then all the attributes it possesses should be related to books such as the number of pages, publishing date or price, etc.
There is no limit to the number of classes we can create in a program. Also, one class can be easily accessible by another, and we can also restrict the access of a class so other classes can not use its functions. This concept comes in handy while working on bigger projects. All the employees are given separate tasks to work on the classes they have been assigned. And after they are done with their contribution, the classes can be combined as a whole to form a complete project. So, now you can understand that to become a successful programmer, you must master the concept of OOP.
